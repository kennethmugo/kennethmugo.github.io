## 🚀 Summary

Over the past 9+ years, I’ve engineered and led the development of robust financial systems at scale—modernizing legacy platforms, spearheading digital lending innovations, and shipping AI-powered products. I bring a rare mix of technical expertise, business acumen, and product thinking that enables me to deliver real-world impact quickly and reliably.

From identity verification systems that have processed over 50,000 successful verifications, to credit risk models deployed in production, to cloud-based wallet APIs used by thousands—I’ve consistently built systems that **scale, secure trust, and deliver value.**

## 💼 What I've Built

### 🔐 Identity Verification & Fraud Detection

- Designed and deployed a multi-stage facial verification pipeline using **computer vision**, **face embeddings**, and **vector databases** to prevent duplicate registrations and identity fraud.
- Leveraged **OCR-free** AI models to classify and extract key details from documents across dozens of ID types.
- Achieved deployment across **web**, **Android**, and **iOS**, including budget devices and edge settings with minimal connectivity.

### 💳 Loan Origination & Credit Scoring

- Migrated legacy loan issuance platforms to **cloud-native** microservices with **event-driven workflows**.
- Integrated **ML models for credit risk assessment and customer segmentation**, driving smarter lending decisions and reduced default rates.
- Built APIs for loan disbursement, repayments, and customer lifecycle management, integrating seamlessly with core banking systems.

### 🧾 High-Throughput Payments & Messaging Gateway

- Engineered a robust payments gateway handling thousands of transactions per second, ensuring **real-time settlements** with strong guarantees around **consistency, availability, and fault tolerance**.
- Integrated with multiple external payment processors and internal systems via **message queues (RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus)** and **distributed transaction coordination**.
- Designed to be horizontally scalable with advanced monitoring, idempotency handling, and support for delayed retries and dead-letter queues.

### 🚚 IoT-Powered Asset & Container Tracking

- Developed a multi-tenant IoT platform that ingested real-time GPS and sensor telemetry from third-party tracking devices installed on shipping containers and high-value assets.
- Built custom gateways to **interpret multiple device protocols**, normalize data, and trigger alerts for curfews, geofencing, tampering, or speeding.
- Enabled both individual and enterprise clients to track assets in real time, review historical trips, and receive automated notifications—all integrated with lending and insurance systems.
- Designed to scale across geographies with **multi-region support** and **high-availability infrastructure** on **Azure**.

### 🤖 AI in Production

- Deployed quantized and optimized models for real-time inference on mobile/web using **TFLite**, **ONNX**, and **Core ML**.
- Applied **unsupervised learning** to detect document quality (blur, lighting, occlusion), enhancing UX and model reliability.
- Trained custom **object detection models** (YOLO, MMDetection, TensorFlow 2 Object Detection) for intelligent automation of ID parsing and fraud signal detection.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Used **K-Means clustering** and behavioral feature engineering to segment borrowers based on repayment patterns, transaction behavior, and loan lifecycle interactions — driving personalized product offerings and improving user retention.
- **Credit Scoring & Risk Assessment**: Developed robust credit risk models using **XGBoost**, trained on a combination of traditional and alternative financial data. These models were integrated into the loan origination system, improving risk prediction accuracy and reducing defaults.

## 🧱 Scalable Architecture & Systems Design

- **Versatile Backend Engineering:**
  Designed and delivered end-to-end backend solutions across diverse fintech verticals—from real-time loan processing platforms and mobile money APIs to high-volume digital wallets—leveraging **.NET Core**, **C#**, and **Python**.

- **Cloud-Native Infrastructure:**
  Architected systems on **Azure**, using **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **microservices** to ensure elastic scalability, high availability, and global performance. Migrated legacy on-prem systems to the cloud, optimizing cost, resilience, and maintainability.

- **Event-Driven & API-First Design:**
  Built asynchronous, event-driven architectures using **Azure Service Bus**, enabling loosely coupled services, scalable task processing, and real-time decisioning. Defined and documented RESTful APIs that powered web, mobile, and third-party integrations.

- **Secure & Compliant Systems:**
  Integrated industry-standard practices for authentication, authorization, and compliance (e.g., PCI DSS, KYC, AML). Employed **OAuth2**, **JWT**, **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**, and encryption-in-transit/at-rest to meet strict fintech security requirements.
